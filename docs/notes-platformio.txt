cd teensy-a(b)
PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/.platformio/penv/bin

pio lib search "id:89"
pio lib search "platform: Espressif 8266 AND keyword:mqtt"
pio lib search "platform: Espressif 8266 AND keyword:serial"
pio lib search "id:89 8266 AND keyword:mqtt"
pio lib search -n mqtt
pio settings get

There is no equivalent icon in VSCode for this command. If you want to do this in VSCode, click on "pio" folder from right side in Teensy A or teensy
B and then selecting delete
rm -rf .pio 


This is the same as the trash can
pio run --target clean

This is the same as the check icon
pio run -v

This is the same as the right arrow icon
pio run --target upload

This is the same as the power plug
pio device monitor

NOTE: WHEN IN TROUBLE and there are issues with common library (i.e., with  LineParsingResult, getToken, etc)  
or when editing lib from IDE and "trash can" doesn't clear prior pio build,
try right clicking ".pio" folder from right side in Teensy A or teensy
B and then selecting delete. This is OK and doesn't hurt anything as .pio will be restored during the next build
